Note: Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of many Unix-based applications, including ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick. If you don't want to use Homebrew, you can also download and install the tools from the official websites:

ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#macosx
GraphicsMagick: http://www.graphicsmagick.org/download.html
However, using Homebrew is recommended as it simplifies the installation and management of dependencies.
